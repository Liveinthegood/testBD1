        <h1 class="bodytext">   Clark Printing was a great experience because it had many exciting projects to do and had many talented artists to do them. Once again, I designed circulars as well as store signs and more on a weekly basis. I did advertisements for Metropolitan, Giunta’s and Pioneer Supermarkets (based in the NYC area) and had great success as my daily efforts increased production and even lightened colleagues work load when it was extremely busy.   

            <img class="BigPicture" src="images/experience.png" alt="secret of success in life logo picture">

            Unfortunately, this moment ended because Clark Printing had to cut its workforce by three to balance their books in late 2019 and I was one of the newest hires. (Seniority) However, I left on very good terms with a very possible return when things got better for them, but the Covid 19 Pandemic hit full swing everywhere in early 2020 as massive layoffs and work stoppages happened all over. Nobody was hiring anyone anywhere unfortunately. We just had to "mask up" and wait. In conclusion, it closed that glorious window for good for me to come back to Clark Printing as we both moved on.
